# Project Title

Pokemon Stay

## Description

This is a fullstack Java implementation of a Pokemon game I've been buidling in my head for many years. It has elements of the original Game-Boy titles, but with a modern twist on Pokemon Go as a management SIM.

Build your Pokemon team and assign your trainers to locations in the classic Kanto region of the original Red/Blue/Yellow games to catch all 151 Pokemon!
